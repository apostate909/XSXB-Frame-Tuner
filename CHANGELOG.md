# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Features

- Default newly added attack-trail sticks to path-only guides except for the current last stick, while preserving manually marked head frames.
- Replace the split pre-stop and post-stop trail chase controls with total trail duration and tail/head speed ratio, shared by Full, Lite, exports, and Godot runtime.
- Distinguish rendered attack-trail head frames from path-only guide sticks, with compact five-button stick controls shared by Full and Lite.
- Add portable frame-bound SFX to Frame Tuner Lite exports and restore those bindings when a Lite sprite sheet is imported again.
- Make Lite export every playable source frame exactly once as a baked owner/attachment/trail composite, with authored frame durations retained as metadata.

### Fixes

- Preserve native source pixel density when baking Unity owner, attachment, and trail composites, compensate the bake density at runtime so authored size and anchors stay unchanged, and import baked textures without Unity compression or a 2048 px cap.
- Keep a selected path-only stick visible as an authoring preview after its head-frame flag is cleared, without making it a runtime or exported head pose.
- Prefer the generated trail over its style preset when opening an action, and label presets as not affecting existing trails so live timing edits apply to the visible trail.
- Keep attack trails advancing continuously across frame boundaries so a longer total duration finishes in following animation frames instead of flashing once.
- Require explicit per-frame trail insertion in Lite; legacy stick-only paths remain editable but no longer render or export automatically.
- Distribute integer Sheet durations without changing the animation total.
- Make `spritesheet.json` the sole descriptor for Sheet exports; PNG sequence exports continue to use `export.json`.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-22

### Features

- Add the isolated Frame Tuner Lite workflow for PNG sequences and JSON sprite sheets, with stable local imports, layered animation editing, shared attack-trail tools, and no Godot or audio binding.
- Export every primary animation in the current Lite character as transparent PNG sequences or re-importable Sprite Sheet + JSON packages, using one automatically measured character-wide canvas and a user-selected destination.
- Save edited attack-trail textures, color treatments, curvature, and motion settings as new named presets without overwriting the bundled default or copying stick paths.
- Add Full and Lite BAT launchers plus a shared single-service launcher suitable for icon-bearing Windows desktop shortcuts.

### Fixes

- Declare UTF-8 for every Full and Lite HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, and text response so Chinese controls such as the trail texture selector cannot be decoded as mojibake.
- Add strict UTF-8 and mojibake regression checks for both web interfaces.

### Documentation

- Document Lite isolation, import formats, character-wide export behavior, launchers, validation, and the compressed attack-trail demonstration embedded in the README.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-21

### Features

- Add a complete editable attack-trail workflow with multiple segments, ordered per-frame sticks, draggable width and tangent handles, per-stick front/behind layering, head curvature, tail retraction, and frame-timing synchronization.
- Add solid, gradient, and original-color texture modes with live preview, stable texture copying, persistent presets, and Godot runtime synchronization.
- Bundle the default `dynamic_trail_luma.png` preset so a new animation can preview a trail before importing a custom texture.
- Add Codex Pets atlas discovery, import, read-only bundled-pet handling, and safe custom-pet writeback.
- Add desktop shortcut artwork and scene-aware profile filtering.

### Performance

- Quantize runtime trail updates to frame-animation timing and use a balanced default smoothness of 20 to reduce mesh rebuild stalls.
- Preserve effective playback duration when switching between group-time and per-frame-time editing.

### Documentation

- Document attack-trail authoring, the bundled preset, local-data isolation, runtime synchronization, and the public demonstration video.
